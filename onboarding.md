# Dong Laboratory Onboarding Information

# Mission Statement
TO BE ADDED

# Expectations

**Your role:** We expect that you will take primary responsibility for the success of your research project and career development.
As a member of the lab, you are expected to participate fully in the team.
In general, lab members are expected to follow weekday working hours that include 9:30AM to 5:00PM in their local timezone to facilitate discussion within the group.
In no cases should recurring meetings be scheduled that routinely fall outside of 8:00AM to 5:00PM for any lab member working within the continental United States.

**Dr Dong's role:** Dr Dong’s goal is to facilitate your success as well as that of your project.
Within your project, Dr Dong will serve as a sounding board for ideas, will help you plan your project, and will help to devise experiments to test your hypotheses.
To facilitate your success, Dr Dong will help you plan your training, devise a career plan that can take you to where you want to go, advise you on your project-risk portfolio, and provide guidance on other elements of career and project development as needed.

**Deadlines:** Our lab has worked hard to develop a reputation for high-quality science that is well-presented.
We all benefit from this reputation, but we must also work to maintain it.
Abstracts for meetings must be shared with all co-authors, including Dr Dong, at least one week *before* the deadline for submission.
Failure to abide by this guideline will result in missing whatever the opportunity in question is.

Trainees in the lab will often receive opportunities to present their work at scientific conferences.
These presentations reflect on the entire lab.
Oral presentations on projects must be presented to the research lab during a `braintrust` meeting, and lab members are expected to address feedback that is provided.
Once a project has been presented once and feedback incorporated, additional presentations are optional in advance of meetings.
Poster presentations should be shared in the `#general` slack channel at least a week before printing.

**Code of Conduct:** All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree with this code of conduct.
We will enforce this code.
We expect cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.
The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).
We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form.
Sexual language and imagery are generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions.
However, do note that we work on biological matters so work-related discussions of e.g. animal reproduction are appropriate.
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Dr Dong immediately.
For additional resolution paths, please see the Yale School of Medicine [SHARE](https://medicine.yale.edu/myysm/personal-resources/sexual-misconduct-resources/) office.
The code of conduct section is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. <http://2012.jsconf.us/#/about> & The Ada Initiative.
Please help by translating or improving: <http://github.com/leftlogic/confcodeofconduct.com>.

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event.

**Authorship:** Our lab follows the [ICMJE's Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals](https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) defintions of the roles of authors and contributors to our manuscripts.

**Ethics:** We expect lab members to be honest in scientific communications both within and outside the lab.
We expect that lab members will design experiments in a manner that minimizes both bias and self-deception.
We expect that lab members will keep agreements, be careful, and share their code and results openly with the scientific community.
We expect that credit will be given where credit is due, including in scientific writing.
Plagiarism is not tolerated.
While a full enumeration of ethical considerations is outside of the scope of this document, Yale provides a [document](https://your.yale.edu/research-support/conflict-interest/responsible-conduct-research-rcr) that we recommend.

In addition, please don't hesitate to raise any questions or concerns that you have at any point with Dr Dong.

**PhD Student Committees:** PhD students will interact with their qualifier and thesis committees.
Students should correspond with the coordinator for their graduate program to understand the expectations that exist around communication with committee members.
Questions about what document(s) their committee will expect to see and when they should be sent to the committee should be resolved with the coordinator at least a month in advance of a scheduled meeting.

**Conference Travel:** We try to make sure that each member of the lab can travel to one conference per year of their choice outside of their home region.
The conference should be within the continental United States or cost-competitive with similar conferences in the continental US.
Lab members who travel to such a conference should submit an abstract for an oral presentation and poster and should present in whatever form is accepted at the meeting.
The conference should be topical for the lab member's research projects and the purpose must align with the grant(s) that support the lab member.
Lab members should first clear such travel with Dr Dong.
Lab members who are invited to conferences or other presentation opportunities with their costs covered by the organization inviting them, e.g., as an invited speaker or keynote, are welcome to accept such invitations.
In all cases, conference travel should be noted on the lab attendance calendar.

# Communication

## General

**Slack:** We use Slack for rapid communication within the lab.
If you plan on sending an e-mail to someone within the lab, try a Slack message instead.
This helps to keep communications in one place, and Dr Dong commits to respond to slacks (not necessarily immediately, but the same guarantee is not made for e-mail).
There are many channels on our lab's Slack; however, it is recommended that newcomers join the following channels: `#general`, `#lab-meetings`, `#journalclub`, `#random`, `#wins`.

**HeyTaco:** We recognize that people regularly go above and beyond lab expectations.
We wanted a way to recognize each other when this happens.
We now use HeyTaco.
This allows lab members to send a quick virtual thank you note and/or pat on the back.
If someone’s paper gets accepted or someone helps you out with a programming question, congratulate or thank them.
Post a message that mentions any user in the `#wins` Slack channel, and they'll get a HeyTaco point.
When one member accumulates enough points, they take the lab out to lunch (Dr Dong pays).

**Social Media:** Lab members are encouraged to communicate through public social media.
If a lab member chooses to do so on an account that notes an affiliation with the lab, the lab member is expected to follow our code of conduct.
Certain employers may require a disclaimer that the lab member's views do not represent those of the employer.

**Projects:** By the nature of our research, lab members will often have the opportunity to participate in projects managed via private or publicly accessible source code repositories.
In these cases, lab members are expected to: follow the code of conduct; expect that private repositories will be world accessible; and to communicate via the project-specific medium
For example, when one lab member reports an issue on a project on GitHub, it would not be appropriate for another lab member to reply "I'll drop by your desk and show you how to solve that."
It would be most appropriate for the conversation to take place on GitHub issues.

**Space:** Space is assigned following the [Yale School of Medicine Space Policies](https://yale.navexone.com/content/dotNet/documents/?docid=139&public=true). 

**Calendars:** 
TBD

**Accounts:** Lab members are expected to have accounts for the following and be members of the specified (organizations) if applicable:

+ GitHub (TheDongLab)
+ Slack (TheDongLab)

## Meetings

**Lab Meeting:** 
- Lab meetings are scheduled for two hours on Tuesdays 10-12pm. All members of the Dong lab are expected to attend if possible. Meetings are expected to be a supportive environment for learning, constructive criticism, help, and scientific discussions. 

   **Meeting Structure:** The lab meeting includes two sessions:

**Update session:** Each member will give a 5-10min update,  plus Q&A for one or two questions or comments. No more than 10min per person. 

**Spotlight session:** One spotlight member each week will give a ~20min presentation + 10min Q&A. The spotlight member doesn’t do Update session above. 

We could add a 5min water break between the sessions.
 
Everyone presenter will need to upload their slides to the shared Lab Meetings folder before the meeting. Each meeting will have a sub-folder named by the date (e.g. 10172024 for this week). The person who last uploaded their slides will present first. We will have a moderator for each meeting. The job of the moderator is to 1) keep timing each speaker to make sure they are on time; 2) check the slide folder to make sure everyone uploaded their slides before the meeting. The spotlight person in the current week will be the moderator of this week.
 
For the **Update session**, it’s essential that one provides a concise yet informative summary of their progress in the past week. Here are some recommendation from ChatGPT for how to help you stay on track:

1. Focus on Key Highlights
Main Accomplishments: Start with one or two major achievements or milestones reached in the past week. This helps set the tone and draws attention to tangible progress.
Challenges or Roadblocks: Briefly mention any significant obstacles you faced, as this can be a good opportunity to solicit quick feedback or suggestions.
2. Current Focus
Ongoing Tasks: Explain the current activities or experiments you are working on. Keep it high-level to avoid getting bogged down in details.
Immediate Next Steps: Describe what you plan to accomplish in the coming week. This gives the team context for where you are heading.
3. Relevant Data or Findings
Key Data Points or Results: If you have new data, you should share the most relevant figures or insights. A single slide with a chart or table can help visualize this quickly.
Implications or Questions: Briefly discuss what these findings might mean for your project and, if relevant, pose any questions you have for the group.
4. Concise Slide(s)
5 Slides Maximum: I would encourage you to use one summary slide with bullet points and, if necessary, a few more slides for any details or visuals. This will help you stay within the time limit.
5. Prepare for Questions
Anticipate One or Two Quick Questions: Members should be ready to address immediate questions or clarify points without going too in-depth. Remind that more extensive feedback can be provided outside of the meeting if needed.

Additional Tips:
Practice: Practicing beforehand can help you fine-tune your timing.
Use a Timer: we will have a timer visible to help you keep track of time during your update.
Be Visual and Concise: Visuals like charts or images can convey information quickly and effectively, so encourage to use them where appropriate.
 
For the **Spotlight session**, we will rotate each member alternatively, so that you will have chance to share your work in depth. Again, please keep your presentation on time and well-prepared ahead of time. Give enough background and details so that people even not on your project can follow. Guests with aligned research interests may join with a super majority vote of lab members (>2/3) and are expected to attend and participate fully.
 
We encourage different types of updates (e.g., see below) to maintain variety and prevent any repetition fatigue. Our goal is to keep the meeting dynamic and engaging for everyone. The different options for meeting formats are outlined below. Each member is expected to lead at least two Braintrust meetings per year (one every 6 months). 

   - **Format 1: Braintrust**
        - The meeting lead presents their own research/project to the group. Presenters often focus on open questions or challenges in their work. Occasionally, they present a new talk or set of slides that they intend to deliver at a meeting, job talk, etc. This is a way for the group to get familiar with each other’s work. It is also a good way to get feedback, advice, or help with research if needed.
   - **Format 2: Tech Talk/Discussion**
        - Talks on commonly used tech in the labs, or strategies for staying on top of the literature, organization, etc.    
   - **Format 3: Post-Conference Presentations**
        - Journal club talk on favorite poster/talk. Either from each person or from a selected set that the group votes on.
   - **Format 4: Big ideas or Projects**
        - This format is meant to help senior members practice for paper discussion sections/conclusions while helping newer members see where the boundaries of fields are.
   - **Format 5: Journal Club**
       - Presentation to be given by meeting leader followed by group discussion. The meeting leader should aim to send the chosen paper one week before the scheduled meeting, and lab members are expected to be familiar with the content for discussion.
   - **Format 6: Preprint Review**
       - Pre-print is discussed by the group. The discussion is led by the meeting leader,  and all members are expected to be familiar with the content. The review is written collaboratively, but another member (not the meeting leader) formats, formalizes and uploads to the pre-print server as a comment.

  **Lab Meeting Schedule:**  A member of the Dong lab is expected to present at their Spotlight session as scheduled in the lab meeting calendar (found [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qv_KqoWvdW7XnbMYYanniLgFCylrBKv_oPOv7jUPEi4/edit?usp=sharing])
   - Each member is expected to sign up as Spotlight presenter by the end of the year. Dr Dong will send email reminder. 
   - Each member will sign up as Spotlight presenter for at least four lab meetings year (e.g. two in each half an year). At least one of these meetings is expected to be a Braintrust meeting every six months.

  **Ad-Hoc Meetings:** After meetings have been scheduled for the semester, any member can add an ad hoc meeting as needed.
   - Ad hoc meetings are meant to help lab members get advice and help on projects, prepare for talks, oral exams, etc.

**Individual Meetings:** While you have change to give updates weekly, you are still welcomed to schedule individual meetings with Dr. Dong. 
 We don’t reschedule these meetings by default if one of the parties (Dr Dong or you) are out of town, so if you do want to meet in a week but travel conflicts, contact Dr Dong and Corinne to reschedule.
 The goal of the meeting is to:

 1.  Discuss challenges.
 2.  Plan strategy (project related, personal career, etc).

**Self Reflection:** Every fix months students, postdocs, and staff will individually meet with Dr Dong to discuss their existing goals, current progress made and set goals for the next interval.
To prepare for these meetings students and staff are required to create an activity report that contains any of the following information (if applicable):

- publications: submitted/accepted/published
- grants/fellowships/scholarships: applied/awarded
- presentations delivered
- posters presented
- meeting abstracts: submitted/accepted
- software releases
- other honors
- goals for the next session: What would you like to accomplish by the end of the next cycle?
- self-reflection. What do you regard as your strengths and as areas where you need improvement?

The report should be in the form of a plain text file, markdown file, or PDF and the file should be called lastname-reflection-yearmonth (e.g. Dong-reflection-202407.txt).
Submit the report in a direct message to Dr Dong via Slack.
During the summer, graduate students are required to complete Yale's individual development plan (IDP[https://your.yale.edu/work-yale/learn-and-grow/career-development/individual-development-planning]).
Post-docs must complete an IDP before their annual contract renewal.
This document covers more in-depth content than the regular triannual self-reflection; therefore, the IDP can be used as a replacement annual report for that cycle.
Because much of the material is overlapping, trainees will benefit from preserving their self-reflection materials in a format that supports copying and pasting to the IDP form.

# Source Code, Data, and Reproducibility

**Pride:** We expect lab members to sign their code, which means that source code contributions are attributable to an individual's account on GitHub.
To quote from _The Pragmatic Programmer_:

> Craftsmen of an earlier age were proud to sign their work.
You should be, too…
People should see your name on a piece of code and expect it to be solid, well-written, tested, and documented.

While some code will be proof-of-concept code, it should be of a form that inspires confidence.

**Language:** We write code for our analyses in R, bash, or Python, which allows everyone in the lab to know at least two languages and understand analytical code.

**Licensing:**
We release as many research outputs as possible under permissive open licenses.
This ensures lab research is reusable and reproducible, with minimal legal barriers.
The default license for software that should be applied to new lab related repositories is the [BSD-2-Clause Plus Patent License](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause-Patent).
This license is [OSI-approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSDplusPatent) and [rated highly](https://blueoakcouncil.org/list) for its simplicity, compatability, and effectiveness.

In certain cases, a funding agency requires a different license or upstream restrictions require certain licensing.
In these cases, the lab may apply a different license.
If you have questions or concerns about licensing, feel free to raise them in Slack.

**Version Control Services:** Our primary version control service is GitHub, and we have a [`TheDongLab` account](https://github.com/thedonglab) there.
We expect that lab members will maintain their code in repositories under these team accounts.
However, lab member should not commit to the branch that is shown as default on GitHub for any of these repositories.
Instead commits happen as described below to facilitate code review.

**Creating a TheDongLab Repository:**

1.  Create a repository under the team account.
2.  Immediately fork this repository into one that your user account owns.
3.  Make commits to your own repository, and move code back to the `TheDongLab` repository as described below.

**Getting Code into TheDongLab Repositories:** Code moves from user repositories to `TheDongLab` repositories through a process of code review.
Code review is handled through pull requests.
The process is described briefly below.
Feel free to ask for guidance if you are uncomfortable with the process.
**We will revoke write access for failing to adhere to these rules.**

1.  Make changes to your code and commit them to your own repository first.
2.  Create a pull request into the repository owned by TheDongLab.
3.  Name potential reviewers for your pull request.
4.  Once at least one lab member has approved your pull request, you or a reviewer may merge your pull request.
The only exception to this policy is this repository ("onboarding") where, in addition to the above rules, Dr Dong must also approve the pull request.

**Composition of Pull Requests:** Each pull request may contain one or more changesets.
In keeping with good source control practice, each changeset or commit should contain *all* changes necessary for a particular fix or update.
In addition, each pull request should relate to no more than one functional area in the code base you are updating.
Keeping the pull request focused to one area makes it easier for your reviewers to provide thoughtful feedback.

**Reviewing Pull Requests:** We expect that all lab members will participate in review of pull requests.
If you get named by the submitter, it's courteous to review the request.
We have created a [checklist](https://github.com/thedonglab/onboarding/blob/master/extras/code_review_checklist.md) to facilitate review.
As a reviewer, you are responsible for making sure that all checklist guidelines are followed.

**Projects that didn't work:** We expect that repositories will contain failures (e.g. proof-of-concepts that didn't work).
This is ideal.
Being able to find them will make sure we don't make the same failure twice.

**Non-Code Versioning:** Non-code documents should be kept in a place that maintains version history.
Both BWH and Yale provide Dropbox for these purposes.

**Data Management:** For publicly available data, scripts used to download and process these data should be preserved, as should the versions of items used in processing (e.g. probe to gene mappings).
These items should be version controlled.
Where possible, intermediate files of reasonable size can be stored to facilitate re-use, but the process to regenerate these files from publicly available data should be preserved.
When we generate data, they should be stored in a location where they are replicated and uploaded to the relevant database as soon as possible (e.g. GEO for gene expression, SRA for sequencing).

**Reproducibility:** We expect all lab members to maintain code that performs reproducible analyses.
This can be in the form of makefiles, shell scripts, or other automation approaches that allow analyses to be automatically performed.
We expect that these scripts, including those to generate figures in papers generated as a consequence of such analyses, will be included in source control repositories (see "Getting Code into TheDongLab Repositories") and made publicly available before or concurrent with the submission of preprint (if submitted) or manuscripts.
Combined with the review guidelines, this means that all code must have been reviewed for these documents to be submitted.
